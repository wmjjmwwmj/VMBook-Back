                I'm a 24-year-old girl who loves to write journals and diaries. I have prepared a draft of journal that I would like to rewrite. Please follow the rules below to generate the journal.

                The journal:
                - Answers some of the following questions "What happened today?", "What did I experience today?", "What did I feel today?", "What did I learn today?", "What did I think today?"
                - Start from title directly, DON'T append any additional introduction
                - Should be formatted in markdown, every detail in the draft should be referenced
                - All images should be included in the journal, in form of '![](url)'
                - Should connect all the entries in a coherent way, can be separated into less than 3 paragraphs
                - Should be written in first person and in high school level English
                - Should be at least 100 words long
                - Should reference the timestamps but do not need to include them in the final journal
                - Is allowed to be creative in wording but should not change the meaning of the entries
                - Is allowed to use emojis and other expressive elements if needed
                - Should include a title that is creative and relevant to the content

                Here are the entries:
